Current version: 1.0

Future Updates Plans: After Front End is Created I will be updating this back end to have a userbase table. I will add Authorization and provate routes. Also more testing of endpoints needs to be written.


## What is StoryBoard?
It is a back end database to store the information a group of writters would need to put together a storyboard of a project or series of films/episodes. During a long talk with a writter friend in LA - he let me know one of the largest areas in his work that was impacted due to the shift to Work From Home was the lack of a good tool to replicate the feeling in a writters room when trying to break a story. 
I am looking to solve that problem. This is StoryBoard's back end - it will be the first step in a tool for writters to work together from afar.

### Structure:
![alt text](https://github.com/Callmich/storyboard/blob/master/designs/StoryBoard%20DB%20final%20V1.jpg)

The basic structure of this project in its current state is that on the top level there are Projects. Next there are tables for Stories, Characters, and Settings that relate back to a project_id. After that there is a table for Scenes that relates back to a story_id. Lastly there are middle tables that connect the tables from the second and third level.

Level 1: Projects

Level 2: Stories | Characters | Settings

Level 3: Scenes

Level 4: story_characters | story_settings | scene_characters | scene_settings | character_settings
