Current version: 1.0

Future Updates Plans: After Front End is Created I will be updating this back end to have a userbase table. I will add Authorization and provate routes. Also more testing of endpoints needs to be written.

## What is StoryBoard?
It is a back end database to store the information a group of writters would need to put together a storyboard of a project or series of films/episodes. During a long talk with a writter friend in LA - he let me know one of the largest areas in his work that was impacted due to the shift to Work From Home was the lack of a good tool to replicate the feeling in a writters room when trying to break a story. 
I am looking to solve that problem. This is StoryBoard's back end - it will be the first step in a tool for writters to work together from afar.
